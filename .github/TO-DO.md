## Notes 

When working on any of these tasks - look at a currently already improved version of this project here [Estuary Redux](https://github.com/MarketingPipeline/Estuary-Redux). To make maintaing both of these projects, we will need to re-use the same class names & HTML structure from it (if possible)
