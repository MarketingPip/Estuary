## Notes 

When working on any of these tasks - look at a currently already improved version of this project here [Estuary Redux](https://github.com/MarketingPipeline/Estuary-Redux). To make maintaing both of these projects, we will need to re-use the same class names & HTML structure from it (if possible)

If you are working on one of these tasks - click the issue beside it & claim it so everyone knows the task is being currently worked on & someone can possibly provide support to your PR.
