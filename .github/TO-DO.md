## Notes 

When working on any of these tasks - look at a currently already improved version of this project here [Estuary Redux](https://github.com/MarketingPipeline/Estuary-Redux). To make maintain both of these projects easier, if possible try to re-use the same class names & HTML structures from it (if possible)

If you are working on one of these tasks - create a issue so everyone knows the task is being currently worked on.
